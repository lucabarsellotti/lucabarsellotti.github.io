Hello! I am Luca Barsellotti, a PhD student of the International Doctorate in Information and Communcation Technologies at University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, where I am supervised by Prof. Rita Cucchiara and Prof. Lorenzo Baraldi in AImageLab.

My research interest is in Object Detection, Semantic Segmentation, Mutimodal Learning and Few-Shot Learning. My scholarship, funded by Leonardo, is focused on Open-World and Few-Shot Dense Predictions.
